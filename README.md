## project Description 
one of the most popular problems nowadays that machine learning solves is satisfaction prediction of system's and services' users according to sruveys made on sample of people, and our main scope of the project is to predict flights passengers satisfaction from some features and ratings taked from the passenger (e.g Age, Wifi service rating, Seat Comfrot, type of travel, class type, ...etc).
- taking steps by starting to analyse the dataset starting from univariate analysis on each feature and then making some bi/mutlivariate analysis seeing the relation between features with each others and between features and target to know wether is there any key factors that afffect user satifaction and make him satisfied to use the same company again and be loyal for it or being dissatisfied and not to be loyal to  the company,
so by doing this analysis helps the decision makers to take the right decision that may keeps their client's loyalty and satisfication (happiness),
as a final step starting to prepare the data for the modeling phase and lastly choosing the best model for predicting if the new customers will churn or not.
- using statistical methods to analyse and extracting information from the dataset like (features distributions, centeral tendancy, measure of despersion and many, boxplots and many other statistical techniques (eg contigency tables, histograms, sunburst plots ... etcs) finishing with classical machine learning classification models and deploy it to web app for graphical using interface.
- tools that i have used are ( Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, plotly.express, plotly.graph_object,  warnings,  sklearn,  flask, heroku)


## files Description
- all files existed related to the web app code
- All Data Analysis and machine learning code and flask app code also exists in ('https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JFmT3YK4PF4MJyGFdtylHBealhK1KwAO/view?usp=share_link')
